## Notebooks for working with PACE and EMIT Hyperspectral Data

### PACE Mission Overview
Launched in February 2024, NASA’s Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) observatory uniquely provides near-daily, hyperspectral coverage of Earth’s surface, plus hyperspectral and hyperangular polarimetry. PACE is a comprehensive Earth System mission, delivering all new, space-based information on the health and diversity of aquatic and terrestrial life (algae, plants), aerosol properties & modes (e.g. smoke, dust), cloud types, and more.
The Ocean Color Instrument (OCI), PACE’s primary sensor, is a hyperspectral (5 nm resolution) imaging spectrometer that measures properties of light from the ultraviolet (UV, 340 nm) through visible and near infrared (NIR, 895 nm) portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, plus 7 shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands. Observations from OCI are moderate spatial resolution (up to 1.2 km ), enabling a relatively frequent revisit time of 1-2 days. This combination of continuous, global coverage and spectral capabilities is unmatched by any other satellite platform, public or private. PACE bene_ts society by expanding our foundational knowledge of Earth and enabling novel, space-based science and applications tools across water resources, air quality, land monitoring & management, and more.

### Collaboration Overview
These notebooks were developed using NASA VITALS and OB.DAAC Help Hub resources to demonstrate how to use PACE and EMIT data synergistically. This series of notebooks is currently a work in progress, but is planning to include notebooks on:
- Colocatining PACE and EMIT overpasses
- Putting colocated scenes on the same grid 
- An example use case combining the stengths of the two missions.
