> Please view the [web-book](https://github.com/nasa/VITALS) for workshop details. **Resources in the VITALS repository have been developed using the Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub cloud workspace. These resources will not work as-is from a local python environment without modification.**

Welcome to the **VSWIR Imaging and Thermal Applications, Learning, and Science** Repository! This repository provides Python Jupyter notebooks to help users work with visibile to short-wave infrared imaging spectroscopy data, thermal infrared data, and other products from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) and ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) missions. The instruments overlapping fields of view provide an unprecedented opportunity to demonstrate the compounded benefits of working with both datasets. 

In the interest of open science this repository has been made public but is still under active development. Make sure to consult the [change log](CHANGE_LOG.md) for the most recent changes to the repository. Contributions from all parties are welcome.
