    "# 2 Working with EMIT L2A Reflectance and NEON L3 Directional Reflectance Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook [Finding Co-located EMIT and NEON AOP Data](https://github.com/nasa/VITALS/blob/main/community_contributed/NEON_EMIT/01_Finding_Co-located_NEON_EMIT_Data_NIWO.ipynb), we found and downloaded co-located EMIT L2A Reflectance and NEON L3 Airborne Reflectance data over the NEON Niwot Ridge site in Colorado. In this notebook, we will open and explore both datasets to better understand the structure of the data from these two sensors, then we will conduct some common preprocessing routines to work with the data together, including applying quality data information relevant to each sensor, cropping, and interactive visualization.\n",

    "The **EMIT** instrument is an imaging spectrometer that measures light in visible and infrared wavelengths. These measurements display unique spectral signatures that correspond to the composition on the Earth's surface. The EMIT mission focuses specifically on mapping the composition of minerals to better understand the effects of mineral dust throughout the Earth system and human populations now and in the future. In addition, the EMIT instrument can be used in other applications, such as mapping of greenhouse gases, snow properties, and water resources.\n",

    "More details about EMIT and its associated products can be found on the [EMIT website](https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/) and [EMIT product pages](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/product_search/?query=EMIT&status=Operational&view=cards&sort=title) hosted by the LP DAAC.\n",

    "The **NEON Imaging Spectrometer (NIS)** is an airborne [imaging spectrometer](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/imaging-spectrometer) built by JPL (AVIRIS-NG) and operated by the National Ecological Observatory Network's (NEON) Airborne Observation Platform (AOP). NEON's hyperspectral sensors collect measurements of sunlight reflected from the Earth's surface in 426 narrow (~5 nm) spectral channels spanning wavelengths between ~ 380 - 2500 nm. NEON's remote sensing data is intended to map and answer questions about a landscape, with ecological applications including identifying and classifying plant species and communities, mapping vegetation health, detecting disease or invasive species, and mapping droughts, wildfires, or other natural disturbances and their impacts. \n",
    "\n",
    "NEON surveys sites spanning the Continental US, Alaska, Hawaii*, and Puerto Rico*, during peak phenological greenness, capturing each site 3 out of every 5 years, for most terrestrial sites (*Hawaii and Puerto Rico are surveyed ~1 out of every 4-5 years). AOP's [Flight Schedules and Coverage](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/flight-schedules-coverage) provides more information about current and past airborne schedules.\n",
