    "# 1 Finding Co-located EMIT and NEON AOP Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Earth surface Mineral dust source InvesTigation (EMIT) instrument is located on the International Space Station (ISS) and has collected data over a large area of the Continental US. The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) collects aerial remote sensing data, including hyperspectral reflectance data over sites across the United States and Puerto Rico. In this notebook we will show how to utilize the [`earthaccess` Python library](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess) to find spatially overlapping EMIT and NEON reflectance data at NEON's [Niwot Ridge](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/niwo) site (NIWO) in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado.\n",

    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **EMIT** instrument is an imaging spectrometer that measures light in visible (V) to short-wave (SWIR) infrared wavelengths; this is also referred to as a VSWIR sensor. These measurements display unique spectral signatures that correspond to the composition on the Earth's surface. The EMIT mission focuses specifically on mapping the composition of minerals to better understand the effects of mineral dust throughout the Earth system and human populations now and in the future. In addition, the EMIT instrument can be used in other applications, such as mapping of greenhouse gases, snow properties, and water resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details about EMIT and its associated products can be found on the [EMIT website](https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/) and [EMIT product pages](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/product_search/?query=EMIT&status=Operational&view=cards&sort=title) hosted by the LP DAAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **NEON Imaging Spectrometer (NIS)** is an airborne [imaging spectrometer](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/imaging-spectrometer) built by JPL (AVIRIS-NG) and operated by the National Ecological Observatory Network's (NEON) Airborne Observation Platform (AOP). NEON's hyperspectral sensors collect measurements of sunlight reflected from the Earth's surface in 426 narrow (~5 nm) spectral channels spanning wavelengths between ~ 380 - 2500 nm. NEON's remote sensing data is intended to map and answer questions about a landscape, with ecological applications including identifying and classifying plant species and communities, mapping vegetation health, detecting disease or invasive species, and mapping droughts, wildfires, or other natural disturbances and their impacts. \n",
    "\n",
    "NEON surveys sites spanning the continental US, during peak phenological greenness, capturing each site 3 out of every 5 years, for most terrestrial sites. AOP's [Flight Schedules and Coverage](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/flight-schedules-coverage) provide's more information about the current and past schedules.\n",
