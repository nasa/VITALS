    "# 3 Equivalent Water Thickness/Canopy Water Content from Imaging Spectroscopy Data\n",
    "\n",
    "> This notebook is part of a numbered series (01-05) that focuses specifically on using EMIT and ECOSTRESS Data together to prepare for future SBG research.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will explore how Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT) or Canopy Water Content (CWC) can be calculated from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) L2A Reflectance Product, then we will apply this knowledge to calculate CWC over the [Jack and Laura Dangermond Preserve](https://www.dangermondpreserve.org/) located near Santa Barbara, CA. \n",

    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT) is the predicted thickness or absorption path length in centimeters (cm) of water that would be required to yield an observed spectra. In the context of vegetation, this is equivalent to canopy water content (CWC) in g/cm^2 because a cm^3 of water has a mass of 1g. \n",
    "\n",
    "CWC can be derived from surface reflectance spectra because they provide information about the composition of the target, including water content. Reflectance is the fraction of incoming solar radiation reflected by Earth's surface. Different materials reflect varying proportions of radiation based upon their chemical composition and physical properties, giving materials their own unique spectral signature or fingerprint. In particular, liquid water causes characteristic absorption features to appear in the near-infrared wavelengths of the solar spectrum, which enables an estimation of its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "CWC correlates with vegetation type and health, as well as wildfire risk. The methods used here to calculate CWC are based on the [ISOFIT python package](https://github.com/isofit/isofit/tree/main). The Beer-Lambert physical model used to calculate CWC is described in [Green et al. (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2005WR004509) and [Bohn et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.111708). It uses wavelength-dependent absorption coefficients of liquid water to determine the absorption path length as a function of absorption feature depth. Of note, this model does not account for multiple scattering effects within the canopy and may result in overestimation of CWC (Bohn et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Jack and Laura Dangermond Preserve](https://www.dangermondpreserve.org/) and its surrounding lands are one of the last \"wild coastal\" regions in Southern California. The preserve is over 24,000 acres and consists of several ecosystem types and is home to over 600 plant species and over 200 wildlife species.\n",

    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the background we use the surface reflectance to estimate CWC. The unique spectral signatures allow identification and quantification based upon the wavelength-dependent absorption coefficients of liquid water. The EMIT mission has applied similar approaches to identify dust source minerals as well as methane point source emissions. The path length of liquid water absorption can be estimated by utilizing a least squares inversion to minimize the residuals between the EMIT reflectance and the Beer-Lambert model (Green et al.,2006), which relates the wavelength-dependent absorption to the path length the photons are traveling through the material. During the inversion, the path lengths are iteratively adjusted to match the modeled spectra to the EMIT reflectance within the water absorption feature region from 850 to 1100 nm.\n",
