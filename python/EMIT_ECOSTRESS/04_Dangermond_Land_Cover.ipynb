    "# 4 Exploring Canopy Water Content (CWC) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) across Vegetation Types in the Jack and Laura Dangermond Preserve\n",

    "**Summary**  \n",
    "In this notebook, we will examine how Canopy Water Content (CWC) derived from EMIT data and Land Surface Temperature (LST) derived from ECOSTRESS change across three different vegetation types and dates in the Jack and Laura Dangermond preserve.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note in previous notebooks, we referenced the CWC product as Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT) because water signal can still be retrieved from non-vegetated surfaces. But, here we will be investigating vegetated surfaces and will reference it as CWC.*\n",

    "**Background**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) acquired the preserve through a generous donation from Jack and Laura Dangermond. The preserve is 24,460 acres of a former private ranch situated at Point Conception, California. Point conception represents the boundary between Northern and Southern California, which separates terrestrial, marine, and coastal ecoregions. This is one of only a few areas globally where the boundary between marine and terrestrial ecosystems exist together. The preserve is one of the last \"wild coast\" areas in Southern California and it has some of the highest biodiversity globally. The Dangermond Preserve offers a unique opportunity to study the impacts of global change; sea level rise, the intensification of wildfire and drought providing a natural laboratory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preserve is naturally composed of oak tree forests and native grasslands; however, in recent years it faces several invasion issues from non-native grasses and iceplant (*Carpobrotus spp.*). The currently mapped invasive plant species at the Preserve include non-native grasslands, iceplant  mats, and stands of black mustard (*Brassica nigra*), poison hemlock (*Conium maculatum*), thistles, and fennel (*Foeniculum vulgare*). Iceplant is one of the priority species listed under the preserve's invasive species management plan.\n",

    "Iceplant is an invasive species native to South Africa that was introduced to California in the 1500s. Because of its ability to stabilize soil in the 1950’s, the Department of Transportation used iceplant to prevent erosion on roadsides. This practice lasted for 20 years before it was discontinued, however, many homeowners still use iceplant for landscaping today. Although iceplant can help prevent coastal erosion, it threatens coastal biodiversity. Iceplant takes up a large amount of soil moisture, thereby taking moisture away from other species. It can also inhibit the establishment of native grass species as a result of a high nitrate accumulation in iceplant soils. Current management efforts to eradicate iceplant at the Dangermond Preserve include cattle grazing. TNC is interested in utilizing enhanced remote sensing techniques to understand iceplant characteristics and detect iceplant locations. \n",
