    "# 1 Finding Concurrent ECOSTRESS and EMIT Data\n",
    "\n",
    "> This notebook is part of a numbered series (01-05) that focuses specifically on using EMIT and ECOSTRESS Data together to prepare for future SBG research.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) and the Earth surface Mineral dust source InvesTigation (EMIT) instruments are located on the International Space Station (ISS). Their overlapping fields of view provide an unprecedented opportunity to demonstrate the compounded benefits of working with both datasets. In this notebook we will show how to search for data using  the [`earthaccess` Python library](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess), then how to filter down results to find concurrently acquired ECOSTRESS and EMIT data. Another notebook offering similar functionality via a different approach is available: [Finding Coincident Airborne and Orbital Data](./Finding_Coincident_Airborne_and_Orbital_Data.ipynb).\n",

    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ECOSTRESS** instrument is a multispectral thermal imaging radiometer designed to answer three overarching science questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How is the terrestrial biosphere responding to changes in water availability?\n",
    "- How do changes in diurnal vegetation water stress  the global carbon cycle?\n",
    "- Can agricultural vulnerability be reduced through advanced monitoring of agricultural water consumptive use and improved drought estimation?\n",
    "\n",
    "The ECOSTRESS mission is answering these questions by accurately measuring the temperature of plants.  Plants regulate their temperature by releasing water through tiny pores on their leaves called stomata. If they have sufficient water they can maintain their temperature, but if there is insufficient water, their temperatures rise and this temperature rise can be measured with ECOSTRESS. The images acquired by ECOSTRESS are the most detailed temperature images of the surface ever acquired from space and can be used to measure the temperature of an individual farmers field.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details about ECOSTRESS and its associated products can be found on the [ECOSTRESS website](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/) and [ECOSTRESS product pages](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/product_search/?query=ECOSTRESS&status=Operational&view=cards&sort=title) hosted by the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **EMIT** instrument is an imaging spectrometer that measures light in visible and infrared wavelengths. These measurements display unique spectral signatures that correspond to the composition on the Earth's surface. The EMIT mission focuses specifically on mapping the composition of minerals to better understand the effects of mineral dust throughout the Earth system and human populations now and in the future. In addition, the EMIT instrument can be used in other applications, such as mapping of greenhouse gases, snow properties, and water resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details about EMIT and its associated products can be found on the [EMIT website](https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/) and [EMIT product pages](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/product_search/?query=EMIT&status=Operational&view=cards&sort=title) hosted by the LP DAAC.\n",

    "\n",
    "To download or stream NASA data you will need an Earthdata account, you can create one [here](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/home). We will use the `login` function from the `earthaccess` library for authentication before downloading at the end of the notebook. This function can also be used to create a local `.netrc` file if it doesn't exist or add your login info to an existing `.netrc` file. If no Earthdata Login credentials are found in the `.netrc` you'll be prompted for them. This step is not necessary to conduct searches but is needed to download or stream data."

    "## 2. Searching for ECOSTRESS and EMIT Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we wish to find concurrent (coincident) EMIT_L2A_RFL and ECOSTRESS_L2T_LSTE products available from the NASA Earthdata Cloud. Conceptually, we know almost all scenes should have a corresponding scene from the other instrument since they are on the same platform. To search for available granules (scenes), we will use the [*earthaccess* Python library](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess), which is designed to simplify authentication and searching for NASA earth science data. \n",
    "\n",
    "After finding the available scenes matching our search critera, we will convert our results to a `GeoDataFrame` and then do some filtering using the available metadata to narrow down our scenes to only those with corresponding scenes collected at the same time from the other instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Define Spatial Region of Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, our spatial region of interest (ROI) will be the a region near Santa Barbara, CA that contains the [Jack and Laura Dangermond Preserve](https://www.dangermondpreserve.org/) and the [Sedgwick Reserve](https://sedgwick.nrs.ucsb.edu/). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a rectangular ROI surrounding these two reserves as well as some of the agricultural region between. Even though the shape is rectangular, we elect to search using a polygon rather than a standard bounding box in `earthaccess` because typically, bounding boxes will typically have a larger spatial extent, capturing a lot of area we may not be interested in. This becomes more important for searches with larger ROIs than our example here. To search using a polygon with earthaccess, we need to format our ROI as a counter-clockwise list of coordinate pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Open the `geojson` file containing the Dangermond and Sedgwick boundaries as a `geodataframe`, and check the coordinate reference system (CRS) of the data."

    "First, log into Earthdata using the `login` function from the `earthaccess` library. The `persist=True` argument will create a local `.netrc` file if it doesn't exist, or add your login info to an existing `.netrc` file. If no Earthdata Login credentials are found in the `.netrc` you'll be prompted for them. As mentioned in section 1.2, this step is not necessary to conduct searches, but is needed to download or stream data.\n",

    "We've included the canopy water content files in the repository to simplify the notebooks so users don't need to perform that operation for the examples in the repository. This means that only 3 granules from our list are required to execute the notebooks and walk through the notebooks in the repository. These are included in a separate text file, `required_granules.txt`. \n",

    ">Note: If interested users can download all of the files using the cell below and recreate all of the canopy water content files following a workflow similar to the example in notebooks 2 and 3 for all of the necessary scenes. To do this, uncomment the `file_list` object with the `search_results.txt` filepath to download all of the results rather than just what is required."
