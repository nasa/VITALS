    "# 2 Working with EMIT L2A Reflectance and ECOSTRESS L2 LSTE ET Products\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we found and downloaded concurrent EMIT L2A Reflectance and ECOSTRESS L2 Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity scenes over our region of interest. In this notebook, we will open and explore both datasets to better understand the structure, then we will conduct some common preprocessing routines to make the data usable together, including: applying quality data, reprojecting, placing data on a common grid, and cropping. \n",

    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ECOSTRESS** instrument is a multispectral thermal imaging radiometer designed to answer three overarching science questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How is the terrestrial biosphere responding to changes in water availability?\n",
    "- How do changes in diurnal vegetation water stress  the global carbon cycle?\n",
    "- Can agricultural vulnerability be reduced through advanced monitoring of agricultural water consumptive use and improved drought   estimation?\n",
    "\n",
    "The ECOSTRESS mission is answering these questions by accurately measuring the temperature of plants.  Plants regulate their temperature by releasing water through tiny pores on their leaves called stomata. If they have sufficient water they can maintain their temperature, but if there is insufficient water, their temperatures rise and this temperature rise can be measured with ECOSTRESS. The images acquired by ECOSTRESS are the most detailed temperature images of the surface ever acquired from space and can be used to measure the temperature of an individual farmers field.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details about ECOSTRESS and its associated products can be found on the [ECOSTRESS website](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/) and [ECOSTRESS product pages](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/product_search/?query=ECOSTRESS&status=Operational&view=cards&sort=title) hosted by the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **EMIT** instrument is an imaging spectrometer that measures light in visible and infrared wavelengths. These measurements display unique spectral signatures that correspond to the composition on the Earth's surface. The EMIT mission focuses specifically on mapping the composition of minerals to better understand the effects of mineral dust throughout the Earth system and human populations now and in the future. In addition, the EMIT instrument can be used in other applications, such as mapping of greenhouse gases, snow properties, and water resources.\n",
